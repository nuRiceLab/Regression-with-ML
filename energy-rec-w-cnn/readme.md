# Energy Reconstruction Using CNNs

A project by Emily Huynh during Summer 2023.

Using 500x500 RGB pixel maps of neutrino collisions, we train and evaluate a convolutional neural network to reconstruct the neutrino's energy.

The pre-trained model has a test loss (MSE) of 1.3, but future fine-tuning should yield improved results.

Thanks to Aaron Higuera for providing the foundation, and to Alex Upton for providing the data generator!
